# NCMLapp - under development
No Code Machine Learning app built with tkinter to use huge variety of machine learning algorithm without coding

A tkinter app to do all.

## Can Dos

* Load data from local
* Load data from some sklearn.datasets
* Preview and select target/features
* Select sklearn or pyspark as framework, pyspark does not work lol.
* With sklearn train and test algorithms, reports training time and accuracy
* Parameter set for the selected models
* Neural-network building interface using Keras

## To Dos

* OpenAI and Huggingface playgrounds.

* Pyspark, t pytorch integration
* k-fold selection
* addition of most used frameworks
* Regression interfaces
* preprocessing mode, more advanced signal processing mode withing preprocessing
* output the model and its implementation as a simple gui/code
