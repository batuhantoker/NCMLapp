# NCMLapp - under development
No Code Machine Learning app built with tkinter to use huge variety of machine learning algorithm without coding

A tkinter app to do all.

# Can Dos

* Load data from local
* Load data from some sklearn.datasets
* Preview and select target/features
* Select sklearn or pyspark as framework, pyspark does not work lol.
* With sklearn train and test algorithms, reports training time and accuracy

# To Dos

* OpenAI and Huggingface playgrounds.
* Parameter set for the models
* Pyspark, t pytorch integration
* k-fold selection
* menubar
* generating new sessions, helding data independently
* multiple frameworks at once
* addition of most used frameworks
* classification/regression/neural network build interfaces
* preprocessing mode, more advanced signal processing mode withing preprocessing
* output the model as a simple gui. to do so tkinter can be dropped. usage of multi OS tools are recommended.
